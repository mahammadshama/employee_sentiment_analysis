- Communication frequency shows a positive relationship with sentiment scores
  
# Recommendations
- Conduct proactive check-ins with employees flagged as flight risks
- Address potential workload, role clarity, or interpersonal concerns
- Encourage broader participation in internal communication
- Use sentiment tracking as an early-warning system for engagement decline
- Extend future analysis with topic modeling to identify drivers of negative sentiment

# Conclusion
This analysis highlights how internal email communication can be leveraged to identify engagement patterns, recognize high-performing employees, and proactively detect potential retention risks. The insights provide a data-driven foundation for improving employee experience and organizational health.
